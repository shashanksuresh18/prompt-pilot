# PromptPilot Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 9 December 2025_

PromptPilot is a Chrome extension that runs entirely in your browser. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.

- The extension only runs on ChatGPT domains (`https://chat.openai.com` and `https://chatgpt.com`).
- It reads the text you type into the ChatGPT input box in order to transform it into a structured prompt and then writes the enhanced text back into the same box.
- All of this processing happens locally in your browser. The extension does not send your prompts or other content to any external server or third party.
- The extension does not use analytics, tracking, advertising, or cookies.
- Chrome’s `storage` permission, if used, is only for simple, non-personal settings (for example, UI preferences). No chat content or personal information is stored there.

If you have any questions about this policy, you can contact me at **shashanksuresh018@gmail.com**.
